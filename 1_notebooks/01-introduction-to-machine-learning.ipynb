    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) described it as: \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" This is an older, informal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "E = the experience of playing many games of checkers\n",
    "\n",
    "T = the task of playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "P = the probability that the program will win the next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use machine learning effectively **you have to understand how the underlying algorithms work**. It is tempting to learn a language such as Python or R and apply various packages to your data without really understanding what the packages are doing or even how the results should be interpreted. This would be a bit like a finance specialist using the Black and Scholes model to value options without understanding where it comes from or its limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of Machine Learning Models ###\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main categories of machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "- Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
    "- Reinforcement Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is concerned with using data to make predictions. We can distinguish between supervised learning models that are used to predict a variable and models that are used for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is concerned with recognizing patterns in data. The main object is not to forecast a particular variable, rather it is to understand the data environment better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for supervised learning contains whare are referred to as **features** and **labels**. The **labels** are the values of the target that is to be predicted. The **features** are the variables from which the predictions are to be made. For example when predicting the price of a house the **features** could be the swuare meters of living space, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the size of the garage and so on. The **label** would be the house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for unsupervised learning consists of features but no labels because the model is being used to identify patterns not to forecast something.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of Data ###\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical\n",
    "- Categorical\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data consists of numbers. Categorical data is data which can fall into a number of different categories, for example data to predict a house price might categorize driveways as asphalt, concrete, grass, etc. Categorical data must be converted to numbers for the purposes of analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard way of dealing with categorical features is to create a dummy variable for each category. The value of this variable is 1 if the feature is in the category and 0 otherwise. For example in the situation in which individuals are categorized as male or female, we could create two dummy variables. For man the first dummy variable would be 1 and the second would be 0. The opposite for women. This procedure is appropriate when there is no natural ordering between the feature values.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is a natural ordering, we can reflect this in the numbers assigned. For example if the size of an order is classified as small, medium or large, we can replace the feature by a numerical variable where *small = 1*, *medium = 2* and *large = 3*."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "The success of a machine learning algorithm highly depends on the quality of the data fed into the model. Real-world data is often dirty containing outliers, missing values, wrong data types, irrelevant features, or non-standardized data. The presence of any of these will prevent the machine learning model to properly learn. For this reason, transforming raw data into a useful format is an essential stage in the machine learning process. One technique you will come across multiple times when pre-processing data is feature normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Normalization is a common practice in machine learning which consists of transforming numeric columns to a common scale. In machine learning, some feature values differ from others multiple times. The features with higher values will dominate the leaning process. However, it does not mean those variables are more important to predict the outcome of the model. Data normalization transforms multiscaled data to the same scale. After normalization, all variables have a similar influence on the model, improving the stability and performance of the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple normalization techniques in statistics. In this notebook, we will cover the most important ones:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to bear in mind that z-scores are not necessarily normally distributed. They just scale the data and follow the same distribution as the original input. This transformed distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 and is going to be the standard normal distribution only if the input feature follows a normal distribution."
